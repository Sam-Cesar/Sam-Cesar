## 🌟 Guiding Principles  
My spiritual journey shapes how I approach IT. These principles guide both my studies and my career:  

1. **Consecration of Time & Talent** — I dedicate my skills and efforts to serving others (Mosiah 2:17).  
2. **Integrity & Accountability** — Trust and transparency are the foundation of discipleship and cybersecurity (Elder Bednar, *The Character of Christ*).  
3. **Lifelong Learning with the Spirit** — I seek knowledge “by study and also by faith” (D&C 88:118).
