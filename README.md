## ✨ Reflections  
I believe faith and technology strengthen each other. Weekly, I write reflections connecting scriptures, talks, and experiences to my IT journey. These insights shape both my discipleship and my professional growth:

D&C 58:26–28 — Teaches me to act with initiative in projects rather than waiting for direction. This motivates me to take ownership of my learning and work.

Mosiah 2:17 — Service is at the heart of discipleship. I apply this by serving users and protecting data, seeing cybersecurity as a way of blessing others.

Elder David A. Bednar, “Come and See” — Reminds me that discipleship is active. My IT studies help me bless others by building ethical and trustworthy systems.

D&C 88:118 — Encourages learning “by study and by faith.” I strive to combine technical problem-solving with spiritual guidance.

Temple Reflections — Eternal covenants remind me that consistency, patience, and stewardship apply both to discipleship and to building reliable, secure systems.
