### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Programming is something that I loved ever since I started in my junior year of high school.

I started programming with Java, right now I am learning JavaScript and some front-end technologies. I am also trying to use more my GitHub while learning the front end.

I have some experience with Unity, made a game that made to the Utah TSA State qualifiers. I got 3 MTAs in intro to programming. I also got some experience in mobile development with xamarin. 

I love learning new things, for example in this quarentine I started to learn æ—¥æœ¬èªž out of boredom. So I really am willing to learn anything you throw my way!!!
